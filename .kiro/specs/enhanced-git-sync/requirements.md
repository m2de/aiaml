# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances AIAML's Git synchronization capabilities to work seamlessly with existing GitHub repositories. Currently, AIAML only works properly with new repositories due to hard-coded assumptions about branch names, missing upstream tracking setup, and lack of synchronization with existing remote content. This enhancement will enable users to connect AIAML to any existing GitHub repository and maintain proper synchronization.

**Related GitHub Issue:** [#1 - Github sync doesn't sync to existing repo (only works with new repos)](https://github.com/m2de/aiaml/issues/1)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with an existing GitHub memory repository, I want to connect AIAML to my existing repository, so that I can continue using my established memory storage without losing existing data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures AIAML with an existing GitHub repository URL THEN the system SHALL detect the remote repository's default branch name
2. WHEN connecting to an existing repository THEN the system SHALL pull existing content from the remote before attempting to push
3. WHEN the local repository doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL clone the existing remote repository instead of initializing a new one
4. IF the existing repository is empty THEN the system SHALL initialize it properly with the correct branch structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user connecting to repositories with different branch naming conventions, I want AIAML to work with any default branch name, so that I'm not forced to use "main" as my default branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to a remote repository THEN the system SHALL dynamically detect the default branch name (main, master, develop, etc.)
2. WHEN pushing changes THEN the system SHALL use the detected default branch name instead of hard-coded "main"
3. WHEN the remote has no default branch set THEN the system SHALL fall back to "main" as the default
4. WHEN creating a new local branch THEN the system SHALL name it to match the remote default branch

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with an existing repository containing memory files, I want AIAML to synchronize with existing content, so that my existing memories are preserved and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to an existing repository with content THEN the system SHALL pull all existing files to the local repository
2. WHEN conflicts arise between local and remote content THEN the system SHALL prioritize remote content and log any conflicts
3. WHEN the existing repository contains memory files THEN the system SHALL validate and integrate them into the local memory system
4. IF existing memory files have invalid format THEN the system SHALL log warnings but continue operation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user setting up AIAML with an existing repository, I want proper upstream tracking configured automatically, so that push and pull operations work correctly without manual Git configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to an existing repository THEN the system SHALL set up proper upstream tracking for the local branch
2. WHEN the local branch doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it and set it to track the remote branch
3. WHEN upstream tracking is configured THEN subsequent push operations SHALL work without specifying remote and branch names
4. IF upstream tracking setup fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to explicit remote/branch specification in Git commands

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user experiencing Git sync issues, I want detailed error messages and recovery options, so that I can understand and resolve synchronization problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Git operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the cause and suggested resolution
2. WHEN branch detection fails THEN the system SHALL log the detection attempt and fall back to safe defaults
3. WHEN repository connection fails THEN the system SHALL distinguish between network issues, authentication problems, and repository access issues
4. WHEN sync operations fail THEN the system SHALL continue local operation and provide retry mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating AIAML, I want the enhanced Git sync to be backward compatible, so that existing configurations continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing AIAML configurations THEN the enhanced Git sync SHALL work without requiring configuration changes
2. WHEN connecting to new repositories THEN the system SHALL use the enhanced logic automatically
3. WHEN the remote URL is not specified THEN the system SHALL continue to work in local-only mode as before
4. IF the enhanced features fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to the previous behavior where possible
