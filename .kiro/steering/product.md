# Product Overview

AIAML (AI Agnostic Memory Layer) is a persistent memory system for AI agents that enables continuity across conversations and sessions. It operates as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing three core tools: `remember`, `think`, and `recall`.

## Core Purpose

Solves the fundamental problem of AI agents having no persistent memory between conversations. Without this capability, AI agents must rediscover user preferences, context, and previously established knowledge in every new interaction.

## Key Features

- **Universal Memory Service**: Works with any AI agent (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.)
- **Local Storage**: All memories stored locally as markdown files for privacy and control
- **Keyword Search**: Find relevant memories using topic and content matching
- **Git Synchronization**: Optional background sync to GitHub repositories
- **Authentication**: API key support for secure remote connections
- **Simple Deployment**: Single command installation and startup

## Target Users

- AI agent developers needing persistent memory capabilities
- Users wanting personalized AI interactions across sessions
- Teams requiring shared memory context between different AI tools
- Privacy-conscious users who want local data control

## Value Proposition

Transforms stateless AI interactions into contextual, personalized experiences by providing a simple, reliable memory layer that any AI agent can use to store and retrieve relevant information.
