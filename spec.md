# AI Agnostic Memory Layer (AIAML) - Product Specification

## Overview

The AI Agnostic Memory Layer (AIAML) is a persistent memory system designed to enable AI agents to store, search, and retrieve contextual information across multiple conversations and sessions. The system operates as a universal memory service that can be used by any AI agent regardless of their underlying architecture or platform.

## Core Purpose

AIAML solves the fundamental problem of AI agents having no persistent memory between conversations. Without this capability, AI agents must rediscover user preferences, context, and previously established knowledge in every new interaction. AIAML provides a standardized way for AI agents to maintain continuity and build upon previous interactions.

## System Architecture

### MCP Server Interface
AIAML operates as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing exactly three tools that AI agents can use:

1. **`remember`** - Store new memories with structured metadata
2. **`think`** - Search for relevant memories using keywords
3. **`recall`** - Retrieve complete memory details by ID

### Memory Storage Format
Memories are stored as individual markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing metadata and markdown content containing the actual memory text.

**File Naming Convention:**
```
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_[8-character-id].md
```

**File Structure:**
```markdown
---
id: [8-character-id]
timestamp: [ISO-8601-timestamp]
agent: [agent-name]
user: [user-identifier]
topics: [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]
---

[Memory content as markdown text]
```

## Tool Specifications

### Tool 1: `remember`
Stores a new memory entry in the system.

**Purpose:** Allow AI agents to persistently store information about users, conversations, decisions, or any contextual information for future reference.

**Parameters:**
- `agent` (string, required): The AI agent name creating the memory (e.g., "claude", "gemini", "chatgpt")
- `user` (string, required): The user identifier associated with this memory (e.g., "marco", "john_doe", "unknown")
- `topics` (array of strings, required): Keywords for categorizing the memory. Each keyword should be a single word (e.g., ["programming", "python", "preferences"], not ["programming languages"] or ["user_preferences"])
- `content` (string, required): The full content to remember as markdown text

**Behavior:**
1. Generates unique 8-character memory ID
2. Creates ISO 8601 timestamp
3. Writes memory file with YAML frontmatter and content
4. Optionally triggers background Git synchronization (if enabled)
5. Returns success response with memory ID

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "memory_id": "abc12345",
  "message": "Memory stored successfully with ID: abc12345"
}
```

**Error Handling:**
If storage fails, returns:
```json
{
  "memory_id": "",
  "message": "Error storing memory: [error description]"
}
```

**Note:** Git synchronization errors do not affect the success of memory storage operations.

**Usage Guidelines for AI Agents:**
- Use `remember` to store user preferences, project details, decisions, or any information that should persist across conversations
- Choose descriptive, single-word topics that will help with future searches
- Include enough context in the content so the memory is useful when retrieved later
- Store specific, actionable information rather than vague summaries

### Tool 2: `think`
Searches for relevant memories using keyword matching across topics and content.

**Purpose:** Allow AI agents to discover previously stored memories that are relevant to the current conversation or task.

**Parameters:**
- `keywords` (array of strings, required): Keywords to search for in memory topics and content. Use specific terms that are likely to appear in relevant memories.

**Returns:**
Array of matching memories (maximum 25 results), sorted by relevance score (highest first):
```json
[
  {
    "id": "abc12345",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.123456",
    "relevance_score": 8,
    "matching_keywords": ["python", "programming"]
  },
  {
    "id": "def67890",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-14T15:45:00.789012", 
    "relevance_score": 5,
    "matching_keywords": ["python"]
  }
]
```

**Relevance Scoring Algorithm:**
- Topic matches are weighted 2x higher than content matches
- Exact word boundary matches receive bonus points
- Score = (topic_matches Ã— 2) + content_matches + user_matches + agent_matches + exact_word_bonus
- Results sorted by relevance score (descending), then by timestamp (most recent first) as tiebreaker

**Error Handling:**
If search fails, returns:
```json
[{"error": "Search failed: [error description]"}]
```

**Usage Guidelines for AI Agents:**
- Use `think` before attempting to recall specific memories or when looking for relevant context
- Use specific keywords that are likely to appear in memory topics or content
- Try multiple related keywords to cast a wider search net
- The relevance scoring helps prioritize the most relevant memories first

### Tool 3: `recall`
Retrieves complete memory details by memory ID.

**Purpose:** Allow AI agents to access the full content and metadata of specific memories identified through search.

**Parameters:**
- `memory_ids` (array of strings, required): List of memory IDs to retrieve (obtained from `think` results)

**Returns:**
Array of complete memory objects:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "abc12345",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.123456",
    "agent": "claude",
    "user": "marco",
    "topics": ["programming", "python", "preferences"],
    "content": "User prefers Python for backend development and has experience with Flask and FastAPI frameworks. Prefers type hints and comprehensive docstrings in code."
  }
]
```

**Error Handling:**
If a memory ID is not found:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "invalid123",
    "error": "Memory with ID invalid123 not found"
  }
]
```

If recall fails entirely:
```json
[{"error": "Recall failed: [error description]"}]
```

**Usage Guidelines for AI Agents:**
- Always use `think` first to discover memory IDs before using `recall`
- Can retrieve multiple memories in a single call for efficiency
- Focus only on relevant information from recalled memories - don't mention irrelevant details to users
- Use recalled information to provide more personalized and contextually aware responses

## User Stories

### Human User Stories

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Personal Preference Management
**Situation:** User mentions they prefer detailed project breakdowns in their work style.

**AI Agent Workflow:**
1. **Store Preference:** `remember(agent="claude", user="john_doe", topics=["preferences", "work", "style"], content="User prefers detailed project breakdowns and likes to review progress weekly. Prefers structured task lists over general descriptions.")`
2. **Later Session - Search:** `think(keywords=["preferences", "work"])`
3. **Retrieve Details:** `recall(memory_ids=["abc12345"])`
4. **Apply Knowledge:** AI automatically provides detailed breakdowns without user having to re-explain preferences

### Example 2: Project Context Continuity
**Situation:** User working on a home renovation project across multiple conversations.

**AI Agent Workflow:**
1. **Initial Storage:** `remember(agent="claude", user="sarah_m", topics=["renovation", "kitchen", "budget"], content="Home renovation project focusing on kitchen remodel. Budget constraint of $15,000. Prefers modern farmhouse style. Timeline: 3 months.")`
2. **Progress Update:** `remember(agent="claude", user="sarah_m", topics=["renovation", "kitchen", "progress"], content="Cabinets ordered from Home Depot. Installation scheduled for next week. Still need to select countertops - considering quartz within budget.")`
3. **Context Retrieval:** `think(keywords=["renovation", "kitchen"])` returns both memories
4. **Informed Response:** AI provides relevant suggestions based on style preferences, budget constraints, and current progress

### Example 3: Multi-Agent Collaboration
**Situation:** User works with coding assistant and writing helper on documentation project.

**Coding Assistant Workflow:**

Database: PostgreSQL. Authentication via JWT tokens. Prefers type hints and comprehensive docstrings.")`

**Writing Assistant Workflow:**
2. **Discover Context:** `think(keywords=["project", "API"])` finds coding assistant's memory
3. **Recall Details:** `recall(memory_ids=["def67890"])`
4. **Informed Documentation:** Writing assistant creates documentation that matches the technical architecture without user re-explaining the setup

### Example 4: Learning Progress Tracking
